Confluence REST Extension Plugin to delete specific versions of attachments

The function of this plugin is to provide REST service for:
 - GET all the versions of given attachment
 - DELETE given version of attachment


REST API endpoints:

for GET
http://{host}/confluence/rest/confrestextension/1.0/attachment/{attachmentId}/getversions

for DELETE:
http://{host}//confluence/rest/confrestextension/1
.0/attachment/{attachmentId}/deleteversion/{version numb}

rest call requires basic auth to check if the user has permission to edit or remove
certain attachment in given space (or he just happens to be a confluence administrator
which your technical account for firing requests to that api probably shouldn't)
