Confluence REST Extension Plugin to delete specific versions of attachments

The function of this plugin is to provide REST service for:
 - GET all the versions of given attachment
 - DELETE given version of attachment
 - DELETE all versions of given attachment

REST API endpoints:

for GET
http://{host}/confluence/rest/confrestextension/1.0/attachment/{attachmentId}/getversions

for DELETE:
http://{host}//confluence/rest/confrestextension/1.0/attachment/{attachmentId}/deleteversion/3

rest call requires basic auth to check if the user has permission to edit or remove
certain attachment in given space (or he just happens to be a confluence administrator
which your technical user for firing request certainly shouldn't)
